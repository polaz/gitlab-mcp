üéØ NATURAL LANGUAGE MAPPING EXAMPLES:
When users ask for:
‚Ä¢ "create a task for backend testing" ‚Üí work_item_type_id="TASK", project_path="group/backend", title="Backend testing"
‚Ä¢ "add a bug issue to frontend" ‚Üí work_item_type_id="ISSUE", project_path="group/frontend", title="[Bug] ..."
‚Ä¢ "create epic for new feature" ‚Üí work_item_type_id="EPIC", namespace_path="group", title="New feature epic"
‚Ä¢ "make a confidential task" ‚Üí confidential=true, work_item_type_id="TASK"

AVAILABLE WORK ITEM TYPES (dynamically discovered):
‚ö° The server automatically detects which work item types are available in your GitLab instance.
   Common types include ISSUE, EPIC, TASK, INCIDENT, TEST_CASE, REQUIREMENT, OBJECTIVE, KEY_RESULT, TICKET.

üîó TYPE HIERARCHY & RELATIONSHIPS:
‚Ä¢ EPIC: Top-level containers for organizing related work (Premium/Ultimate)
  - Can contain: ISSUE, TASK, INCIDENT, REQUIREMENT, TEST_CASE, OBJECTIVE
  - Use for: Major features, initiatives, product areas
  - Type names: "EPIC" (case-insensitive)
  - **SCOPE**: ALWAYS group-level only - use namespace_path, never project_path
‚Ä¢ ISSUE: Standard work items for bugs, features, and user stories
  - Can contain: TASK, TEST_CASE, REQUIREMENT
  - Use for: Individual features, bug reports, user stories
  - Type names: "ISSUE" (case-insensitive)
‚Ä¢ TASK: Granular work items that break down issues
  - Cannot contain other items (leaf nodes)
  - Use for: Implementation steps, subtasks, checklist items
  - Type names: "TASK" (case-insensitive)
‚Ä¢ OBJECTIVE: High-level business goals (OKR system)
  - Can contain: KEY_RESULT
  - Use for: Business objectives, quarterly goals
  - Type names: "OBJECTIVE" (case-insensitive)
‚Ä¢ KEY_RESULT: Measurable outcomes for objectives
  - Cannot contain other items
  - Use for: Metrics, KPIs, measurable targets
  - Type names: "KEY_RESULT", "KEY RESULT" (handles both formats)
‚Ä¢ INCIDENT: Service disruption tracking
  - Can contain: TASK
  - Use for: Production issues, outages, service problems
  - Type names: "INCIDENT" (case-insensitive)
‚Ä¢ TEST_CASE: Quality assurance work items
  - Cannot contain other items
  - Use for: Test scenarios, QA verification steps
  - Type names: "TEST_CASE", "TEST CASE" (handles both formats)
‚Ä¢ REQUIREMENT: Product/business requirements
  - Can contain: TEST_CASE, TASK
  - Use for: Specifications, acceptance criteria
  - Type names: "REQUIREMENT" (case-insensitive)
‚Ä¢ TICKET: General purpose work items
  - Similar to ISSUE but for different organizational contexts
  - Type names: "TICKET" (case-insensitive)

REQUIRED FIELDS:
- work_item_type_id: Work item type identifier - can be either:
  * Type NAME (e.g., "ISSUE", "TASK", "EPIC") - automatically resolved via dynamic discovery
  * Global ID (e.g., "gid://gitlab/WorkItems::Type/2") - direct GitLab identifier

‚ö° DYNAMIC TYPE DISCOVERY: The server automatically discovers available work item types from your GitLab instance on startup, eliminating the need for hardcoded type mappings.

- title: Descriptive title for the work item
- project_path OR namespace_path: Context location

CURRENTLY SUPPORTED FIELDS:
- title: Work item title (required)
- description: Markdown description (optional)
- confidential: Privacy setting (optional)

WIDGET SUPPORT STATUS:
‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT LIMITATION: Advanced widget operations are not yet implemented in create_work_item.
The following features are planned for future enhancement:

PLANNED WIDGET CAPABILITIES:
- Hierarchy: Parent/child relationships between work items
- Assignees: Users responsible for the work
- Labels: Categorization and filtering tags
  ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Agents should ONLY use labels that already exist in the project/group scope.
  Use list_labels or search functions to discover existing labels before assigning them.
  Creating new labels should be done explicitly through separate label management functions after user approval.
- Milestone: Release/sprint association
- Iteration: Sprint/iteration assignment (Premium/Ultimate)
- Health Status: On track/needs attention/at risk
- Progress: Percentage completion
- Weight: Story points or complexity estimation
- Start/Due Dates: Timeline planning

CURRENT WORKFLOW:
1. Create basic work item with create_work_item (title, description, confidential)
2. Use update_work_item for advanced widget operations (when implemented)
3. Use get_work_item to inspect created work item with all widgets

COMMON USAGE PATTERNS:
1. Epic ‚Üí Issues ‚Üí Tasks (hierarchical planning)
2. Objective ‚Üí Key Results (OKR tracking)
3. Incident ‚Üí Tasks (incident response)
4. Requirement ‚Üí Test Cases (quality assurance)""",

List Work Items from a project or group using GitLab's modern Work Items API (GraphQL).
Unlike search tools, this can retrieve ALL work items without any search query required.

üéØ CRITICAL USAGE PATTERNS:
‚úÖ "find all issues in project X" ‚Üí list_work_items(project_path="X")
‚úÖ "show open bugs in project Y" ‚Üí list_work_items(project_path="Y", search="bug", state="OPENED")

‚úÖ "get epics from team" ‚Üí list_work_items(namespace_path="team", work_item_types=["EPIC"])
‚úÖ "what's in the backlog" ‚Üí list_work_items(state="OPENED", work_item_types=["ISSUE", "TASK"])
‚ùå "find all issues in project X" ‚Üí search_project() [WRONG - requires search term]

üéØ NATURAL LANGUAGE MAPPING EXAMPLES:
When users ask for:
‚Ä¢ "show tasks from backend" ‚Üí project_path="group/backend", work_item_types=["TASK"]
‚Ä¢ "list issues in frontend project" ‚Üí project_path="group/frontend", work_item_types=["ISSUE"]
‚Ä¢ "get epics from team" ‚Üí namespace_path="team", work_item_types=["EPIC"]
‚Ä¢ "show open items" ‚Üí state="OPENED" (omit work_item_types for all types)
‚Ä¢ "find bugs in project" ‚Üí search="bug" (searches titles and descriptions)
‚Ä¢ "show tasks and issues" ‚Üí work_item_types=["TASK", "ISSUE"]
‚Ä¢ "what's in the backlog" ‚Üí state="OPENED", work_item_types=["ISSUE", "TASK"]

SCOPE OPTIONS:
- project_path: List work items within a specific project (e.g., "mygroup/backend")
- namespace_path: List work items within a group/namespace (includes subgroups)

FILTERING CAPABILITIES:
- work_item_types: Filter by specific types using dynamic discovery
  * Use type NAMES (e.g., ["ISSUE", "TASK", "EPIC"]) - case-insensitive
  * Or use global IDs (e.g., ["gid://gitlab/WorkItems::Type/2"])
  * Multiple types can be specified as array
  * Omit to return all types

‚ö° DYNAMIC TYPES: The server automatically discovers available work item types from your GitLab instance, so you can use the actual type names without worrying about instance-specific IDs.
- state: Filter by work item state
  * OPENED: Active work items
  * CLOSED: Completed work items
  * ALL: Both open and closed
- search: Text search across titles and descriptions
  * Searches work item titles and content
  * Supports partial matching
- first: Pagination limit (default 50, max 100)
- after: Pagination cursor for subsequent pages

RETURNED INFORMATION:
- Basic identifiers: id, iid, title, state
- Work item type information
- Author details and creation/update timestamps
- Direct web URLs for GitLab navigation
- Pagination info for large result sets

COMMON USE CASES:
1. Project planning: List all epics in a group
2. Sprint management: List open issues in a project
3. Task tracking: List tasks under specific parent items
4. Incident response: List open incidents across organization
5. OKR tracking: List objectives and key results
6. Quality assurance: List test cases for testing cycles

PERFORMANCE NOTES:
- Group-level queries may return large result sets
- Use pagination (first/after) for better performance
- Consider filtering by type and state to reduce results""",

REQUIRED IDENTIFICATION:
- id: Global Work Item ID (format: gid://gitlab/WorkItem/123)
  * Must be obtained from get_work_item or list_work_items responses
  * Verify the correct work item before deletion

DELETION IMPACT BY TYPE:

‚Ä¢ EPIC Deletion:
  - Removes the epic container permanently
  - Child work items (issues, tasks) become orphaned but remain
  - Epic-child relationships are severed
  - All epic-specific data (description, labels, etc.) lost forever
  - Consider reassigning children to another epic first

‚Ä¢ ISSUE Deletion:
  - Removes issue and all associated data permanently
  - Child tasks become orphaned but remain
  - All comments, assignees, labels, and metadata lost
  - Issue references in code/commits become broken links
  - Consider closing instead of deleting for historical tracking

‚Ä¢ TASK Deletion:
  - Removes task work item permanently
  - Parent-child relationship automatically updated
  - All task progress and data lost forever
  - Least risky deletion as tasks are typically granular

‚Ä¢ OBJECTIVE/KEY_RESULT Deletion:
  - Removes OKR tracking data permanently
  - Breaks objective-key result relationships
  - All progress and measurement data lost
  - Impact on business goal tracking

‚Ä¢ INCIDENT Deletion:
  - Removes incident tracking permanently
  - Child tasks become orphaned
  - All incident response data and timeline lost
  - Not recommended for completed incidents (close instead)

‚Ä¢ TEST_CASE/REQUIREMENT Deletion:
  - Removes quality assurance data permanently
  - Breaks requirement-test relationships
  - All testing history and results lost

PERMISSION REQUIREMENTS:
- Must have appropriate permissions for the project/group
- Only work item authors, assignees, and project maintainers can delete
- Some organizations may restrict deletion permissions

SAFE DELETION PRACTICES:
1. Always use get_work_item first to verify correct item
2. Check for child work items and reassign if needed
3. Consider closing instead of deleting for auditability
4. Export important data before deletion
5. Verify no critical references exist in code or documentation

ALTERNATIVE TO DELETION:
- Close work items instead to maintain historical records
- Use confidential setting to hide sensitive work items
- Archive projects to remove from active view while preserving data""",

WHEN TO USE search_project vs list_work_items:
- search_project: When searching for SPECIFIC KEYWORDS in issue content
- list_work_items: When listing ALL issues/tasks/epics (no search term needed)

IMPORTANT: Each search call targets ONE specific scope/content type. To search multiple types, make separate calls for each scope.

SUPPORTED SEARCH SCOPES (choose one per call):
- 'projects': Project metadata (name, description, topics)
- 'blobs': File contents within repository code
- 'wiki_blobs': Wiki page contents and documentation
- 'issues': Issue titles and descriptions
- 'merge_requests': Merge request titles and descriptions
- 'commits': Commit messages and metadata
- 'milestones': Milestone titles and descriptions
- 'notes': Comments on issues and merge requests

MULTI-TYPE SEARCH STRATEGY:
To search across multiple content types (e.g., both issues AND merge requests):
1. Make separate search_project calls for each scope
2. Use same search term with different scope parameters
3. Combine results programmatically for comprehensive coverage

EXAMPLE MULTI-SCOPE USAGE:

- Call 3: search_project(project_id="my/project", scope="blobs", search="authentication")

REQUIREMENTS:
- project_id: Project path (e.g., 'group/project') or numeric ID

- Includes public projects and private projects where you're a member
- Results limited by your GitLab permissions and instance search limits
- Blob search may require Premium/Ultimate subscription

REQUIREMENTS:
