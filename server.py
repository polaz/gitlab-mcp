REQUIRED IDENTIFICATION:
- id: Global Work Item ID (format: gid://gitlab/WorkItem/123)
  * Must be obtained from get_work_item or list_work_items responses
  * Verify the correct work item before deletion

DELETION IMPACT BY TYPE:

‚Ä¢ EPIC Deletion:
  - Removes the epic container permanently
  - Child work items (issues, tasks) become orphaned but remain
  - Epic-child relationships are severed
  - All epic-specific data (description, labels, etc.) lost forever
  - Consider reassigning children to another epic first

‚Ä¢ ISSUE Deletion:
  - Removes issue and all associated data permanently
  - Child tasks become orphaned but remain
  - All comments, assignees, labels, and metadata lost
  - Issue references in code/commits become broken links
  - Consider closing instead of deleting for historical tracking

‚Ä¢ TASK Deletion:
  - Removes task work item permanently
  - Parent-child relationship automatically updated
  - All task progress and data lost forever
  - Least risky deletion as tasks are typically granular

‚Ä¢ OBJECTIVE/KEY_RESULT Deletion:
  - Removes OKR tracking data permanently
  - Breaks objective-key result relationships
  - All progress and measurement data lost
  - Impact on business goal tracking

‚Ä¢ INCIDENT Deletion:
  - Removes incident tracking permanently
  - Child tasks become orphaned
  - All incident response data and timeline lost
  - Not recommended for completed incidents (close instead)

‚Ä¢ TEST_CASE/REQUIREMENT Deletion:
  - Removes quality assurance data permanently
  - Breaks requirement-test relationships
  - All testing history and results lost

PERMISSION REQUIREMENTS:
- Must have appropriate permissions for the project/group
- Only work item authors, assignees, and project maintainers can delete
- Some organizations may restrict deletion permissions

SAFE DELETION PRACTICES:
1. Always use get_work_item first to verify correct item
2. Check for child work items and reassign if needed
3. Consider closing instead of deleting for auditability
4. Export important data before deletion
5. Verify no critical references exist in code or documentation

ALTERNATIVE TO DELETION:
- Close work items instead to maintain historical records
- Use confidential setting to hide sensitive work items
- Archive projects to remove from active view while preserving data""",

IMPORTANT: Each search call targets ONE specific scope/content type. To search multiple types, make separate calls for each scope.

SUPPORTED SEARCH SCOPES (choose one per call):
- 'projects': Project metadata (name, description, topics)
- 'blobs': File contents within repository code
- 'wiki_blobs': Wiki page contents and documentation
- 'issues': Issue titles and descriptions
- 'merge_requests': Merge request titles and descriptions
- 'commits': Commit messages and metadata
- 'milestones': Milestone titles and descriptions
- 'notes': Comments on issues and merge requests

MULTI-TYPE SEARCH STRATEGY:
To search across multiple content types (e.g., both issues AND merge requests):

2. Use same search term with different scope parameters
3. Combine results programmatically for comprehensive coverage

- Call 2: search_project(project_id="my/project", scope="merge_requests", search="authentication")
- Call 3: search_project(project_id="my/project", scope="blobs", search="authentication")

REQUIREMENTS:

- 'blobs': File contents across all repositories (requires Premium/Ultimate)

- 'issues': Issue titles and descriptions across all projects
- 'merge_requests': Merge request titles and descriptions across all projects
- 'commits': Commit messages and metadata across all repositories
- 'milestones': Milestone titles and descriptions across all projects
- 'notes': Comments on issues and merge requests across all projects

MULTI-TYPE SEARCH STRATEGY:
To search across multiple content types globally (e.g., issues AND merge requests across all projects):

SCOPE COVERAGE:
- Most comprehensive search across all accessible GitLab content
- Includes public projects and private projects where you're a member
- Results limited by your GitLab permissions and instance search limits
- Blob search may require Premium/Ultimate subscription

REQUIREMENTS:
- scope: Single content type from list above
- search: Search term (minimum 3 characters, no wildcards like '*')
